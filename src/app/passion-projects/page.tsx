                Our 1:1 Technical Mentorship program equips our mentees with
                valuable technical and soft skills during the cohort. As part of
                their graduation each mentee develops and builds a passion
                project of their choice that incorporates their newly learned
                skills. This gives our mentees real life experience with their
                skills as well as a project for their portfolio they can use for
                further career building.

                We have seen incredible passion projects over the years
                including websites, online games, UI/UX design, apps and much
                more. It is always a privilege to witness all the innovative and
                creative ideas our mentees are able to realize in a short time
                frame. We are excited to see everything there is yet to come
                from them on their continued professional development journey.
